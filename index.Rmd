# Preface {-}

Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover since our growing demand for natural resources has caused significant environmental impacts. 

This book presents  **sits**, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis. The package supports the application of machine learning techniques for classification image time series obtained from data cubes. Methods available include linear and quadratic discrimination analysis, support vector machines, random forests, boosting, deep learning, and convolution neural. The package also provides functions to post-classification and sample quality assessment.

## Who this book is for {-}

This book is recommended for researchers and experts that want to use the full potential of Earth observation data cubes for time series analysis and classification. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R. The examples of the book are largely self-explanatory. Background information for the data science methods used in the book is available in the following references:
