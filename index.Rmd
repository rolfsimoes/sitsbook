# Preface {-}

Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover since our growing demand for natural resources has caused significant environmental impacts. 

This book presents the **sits**, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis. The package supports the application of machine learning techniques for classification image time series obtained from data cubes. Methods available include linear and quadratic discrimination analysis, support vector machines, random forests, boosting, deep learning, and convolution neural. Out of the box, **sits** also provides functions to post-classification (e.g., spatial bayesian smoothing) and sample evaluation (e.g., self-organizing maps clustering) and more!

So, check it out to learn about satellite image time series analysis and classification using several techniques and methods through **sits** package.

## Who this book is for {-}

This book is recommended for all those who wish to learn the main concepts and techniques of time series analysis and classification of remotely sensed images through the **sits** package. The approach taken by this book is practical, and all examples are designed to be self-contained, making the learning experience more accessible, even for those with minimal programming experience.
